📶 Telecom Churn Analysis 📊

📄 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a telecom churn dataset to uncover customer churn patterns and develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning models, this project provides actionable insights for improving customer retention and satisfaction.

🎯 Business Use Cases

-Customer Retention Analysis: Identify churn factors to improve retention strategies.
-Usage Pattern Analysis: Understand customer behavior to offer personalized services.
-Risk Assessment: Build a model to predict high-risk customers likely to churn.

🛠️ Approach

-Step 1: Data Import & Preparation
Import the dataset into Python.
Clean the data by handling missing values and correcting data types.
Remove personal identifiers to ensure data privacy.
Perform transformations (e.g., creating calculated fields).

-Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Understand key metrics like mean and variance.

Visualizations:
📅 Tenure Distribution: Visualize customer account lifespans.
💰 Monthly Charges: Analyze the distribution of monthly charges.
🚪 Churn Status: View churn vs. non-churn customer counts.
📈 Correlation Analysis: Study relationships between variables like minutes used and charges.

-Step 3: Business Insights
Churn Rate by Contract Type: Evaluate churn across contract types (month-to-month, annual).
International & Voice Mail Plans: Assess the impact of these plans on churn.
Customer Service Calls: Analyze how the frequency of calls affects churn rates.

🤖 Model Development
Feature Selection: Identify key drivers like tenure and service usage.
Model Training:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).
Evaluate Performance: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Interpretation: Use feature importance to understand predictions.

📋 Additional Insights
International Plan Impact: Does it reduce churn?
Voice Mail Plan Impact: Compare churn between customers with and without the plan.
Usage Comparison: Explore the differences between churned and non-churned customers.
